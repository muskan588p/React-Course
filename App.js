/**
 * JSX: JavaScript XML
 * JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement(JS Object) => HTMLElement(render) => DOM(Browser)
 *
 * JSX is a syntactic sugar for React.createElement
 * JSX is not a valid JavaScript, it needs to be transpiled using Bable to React.createElement before it can be rendered in the browser using ReactDOM
 * JSX (transpiled before it can be rendered in the browser using ReactDOM) => Parcel (Bundler) => Babel (Transpiler) => React.createElement => ReactDOM
 * JSX is optional, you can write React without JSX
 * JSX is more readable and easy to write
 * JSX is more like HTML
 * JSX is look like HTML or XML like syntax, but it's not HTML or XML. It's a syntax extension of JavaScript.
 * JSX is mixed of JavaScript and HTML like syntax that allows us to write HTML like code in React. 
 * JSX prevents cross-site injection attacks by escaping any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. 
 * 
 * Babel is a transpiler that converts JSX into React.createElement calls before it can be rendered in the browser using ReactDOM
 * Babel: JavaScript compiler that takes your modern JavaScript code (ES6) and returns code that most browsers can understand.
